🛠️ Gallery – DevOps & CI/CD Integration Showcase
This repository is a demonstration of DevOps automation and CI/CD workflows using Jenkins and GitHub. It showcases pipeline creation, environment integration and deployment for assessing hands-on DevOps competency.

✅ Key Deliverables
🔧 1. Jenkins Pipeline Setup
Designed and configured a multi-stage Jenkins pipeline using a declarative Jenkinsfile.

Stages include:

🔍 Code check

🧪 Mocha Tests

🏗️ Build 

📦 Deployment to Render

Automatically triggered on GitHub commits via webhooks.


🧪 2. CI Integration
Connected Jenkins with GitHub via ngrok to run automated tests on push/merges to the master branch.

Jenkins logs stored and monitored for success/failure status.


🚀 3. Deployment Automation (optional if included)
Configured Jenkins to trigger deployment to a remote environment (e.g., Docker, Netlify, or a test server) upon successful build.

Used Jenkins credentials binding and secure secret management for environment variables.
